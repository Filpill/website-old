	<h1>UAV Aircraft Design</h1>

		<div class ="text">

			<strong> <p>Project Introduction and Scope:</p> </strong>

			<p>My elected project for my 4th year in University was to design and build a UAV aircraft. The design requirements were driven out from the 2017 BMFA competition (Payload Challenge). The design had to be capable of flying some circuits with varying volumes of water weighing up to 3.5kg.</p>

			<p>As project engineer, I was responsible for coordinating the technical requirements and outputs between our sub-teams.</p>

			<strong> <p>Here are some highlights from the Group UAV project:</p> </strong>

	<h2>Aircraft Design Process</h2>

		<div class ="text">

			<strong> <p>Design Overview</p> </strong>

			<p> The aircraft design process used in this project is an adaptation of the design process learnt in university for commercial passenger aircraft design. The design tools and flight mechanic equations developed previously have been repurposed such to fit the requirements for a UAV application.</p>
			<p> To narrow the focus of our design point, data is collected on other aircraft configurations focused around payload missions. This data collection and market analysis process is a critical element to estimating the conceptual aircraft size and Maximum Take-off Weight (MTOW). </p>
			<p> The design feasibility relies on estimating a relatively sensible MTOW. It is expected that early MTOW estimates may vary &plusmn;20% from the final result, however it is sufficient as a starting point.</p>
			<p> The entire design process is cyclic and interdependant on other design elements, for example: adjustments in aerodynamic configuration may require a re-assessment of the centre of gravity positioning. There are hundreds of other situtations were systems are interconnected and require engineering attention. </p>
			<p> Beyond the conceptual design, we are relying on emulating design practices within the aircraft model building community in order to achieve a mechnical design that does not add any unecessary weight. </p>
			<p> We have elected to stick with a highly conventional configuration which has been tried and tested. The materials involved are mixture between balsawood, plywood and carbon fibre. This list of materials provide a good stength to weight ratio for the mission we are designing for. </p>
			<p> Areas of the aircaft which experience high loading (e.g. landing gear, wing root etc.) have been reinforced with plywood and less stressed areas are built with the less dense materials such as balsa to maintain a low overall empty weight.<p>
			<p> The conceptual and detailed design phases have been summerised here :<p>
